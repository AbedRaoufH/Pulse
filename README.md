## 🔧 Tech Stack
- C (backend logic, system metrics)
- Python (GUI using tkinter or PySimpleGUI)
- ctypes (for C-Python bridge)

## 🚀 Goals
- Clean, simple interface
- Beginner-friendly codebase
- Open to future expansions

## ❗ Status
🚧 Work in progress — no code yet, just planning out the structure.
